## Error Responses

- **400 Bad Request**
  - **Missing body / wrong type**
    - Returned when neither `leadIds` nor `leads` is provided, or when the value is not an array.
    - Examples:
      - `{ "error": "Either leadIds or leads array is required" }`
      - `{ "error": "Input must be an array" }`
  - **Too many leads**
    - Returned when the number of items exceeds the maximum per request.
    - Example: `{ "error": "Maximum of 1000 leads allowed per request" }` (limit may be overridden by config).
  - **Per-lead validation errors / bad leads**
    - Individual leads that fail validation (duplicate, bad phone, etc.) are reported in the `errors` array.
    - Typical messages include:
      - `"A call attempt has already been made to this phone number for this project"`
      - `"Phone number contains repeating digits pattern"`
      - `"already exists for this project and process"`
    - **These indicate bad/invalid leads. Do not retry these specific leads via this API.**
    - Recommended behavior:
      - Mark those leads as invalid in your system.
      - Fix the underlying data (phone number, process, etc.) before attempting again as new leads.

- **403 Forbidden**
  - Returned when some leads have missing or invalid `projectId` relative to the authenticated project.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Some leads have missing or invalid projectId",
      "invalidLeads": [
        { "data": { ... }, "error": "missing projectId" },
        { "data": { ... }, "error": "projectId does not match authenticated project" }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - Also returned when the target project is inactive or not found.

- **404 Not Found**
  - Returned when a `processId` in the `leads` array does not exist.
  - Example: `{ "error": "Process not found for lead with processId: <id>" }`

- **429 Too Many Requests**
  - Bulk initiate uses the same project-level rate limiting and duplicate protection as the single-lead initiate API.
  - If you continuously send duplicate or bad data, your API key may be temporarily blocked.
  - **Do not keep retrying the same bad leads**, as this can cause more 429s and longer blocks.

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  - Unexpected server-side error.
  - Safe to retry with exponential backoff **only** for 5xx responses (not for 4xx).

## Retry Guidance

- **Do not retry bad leads**
  - Any per-lead validation/duplicate errors returned in the `errors` array should be treated as permanent failures for those payloads.
  - Re-sending the same bad lead can:
    - Trigger duplicate-protection limits.
    - Lead to `429` blocks for your API key.
- **When to retry**
  - It is acceptable to implement retries (with backoff) for:
    - Network errors.
    - 5xx responses (`500` and other server errors).
  - Do **not** automatically retry on 4xx responses; fix the request or underlying data instead.
