## What is an Agent?

Uservox agents are AI-powered voice assistants that can handle inbound and outbound conversations, qualify leads, answer questions, book meetings, and update your CRM — all autonomously.

- Understand intent and context in real time
- Follow configurable conversation flows and guardrails
- Integrate with CRMs and business systems to read/write data
- Provide call summaries, transcripts, and outcomes automatically

## Create an Agent

1. Go to the Dashboard at https://app.uservox.ai
2. Navigate to Agents and click New Agent
3. Configure basics
   - Name, purpose, default language and voice
   - Knowledge sources (FAQs, product info, website)
4. Define conversation behavior
   - Greeting, qualification questions, fallback behavior
   - CRM fields to capture (e.g., name, email, company, budget)
5. Integrations (optional)
   - Connect your CRM so the agent can read/write lead records
   - Enable calendar or webhooks if needed
6. Save and publish

## Try an Agent

- Test Call: Use the Test/Preview to simulate calls directly in the browser
- Sample Leads: Trigger a sample outbound flow to hear the script
- Monitoring: Review transcripts, outcomes, and captured fields after each test

## Best Practices

- Keep qualification concise (3–5 key questions)
- Add clear success and disqualification criteria
- Set up guardrails for unsupported topics
- Connect your CRM for end-to-end automation
