title: "Dashboard"
description: "The Daily Dashboard in UserVox.ai provides a snapshot of calling activity and outcomes on a day-to-day basis. Unlike Cohort Analytics (which is tied to lead insertion date), the Daily Dashboard tracks real-time daily performance, showing how many calls were made, how many leads showed interest, and how many call minutes (pulses) were consumed.

## 1. Key Metrics

- **Total Calls (Daily)**\
  Number of outbound calls attempted on a given day, across all leads (new or old).
- **Connected Calls**\
  Number of calls successfully connected (customer picked up).
- **Interested Calls**\
  Subset of connected calls where the lead expressed interest.
- **Lost Calls**\
  Calls that resulted in disqualification, wrong number, or explicit non-interest.
- **Not Concluded**\
  Calls that are pending follow-up, callback scheduled, or where the customer didn’t provide a clear response.

---

## 2. Conversion Indicators

- **Daily Conversion Rate (Connected → Interested)**\
  Percentage of connected calls that converted into interest.\
  Formula = Interested Calls ÷ Connected Calls.
- **Daily Interest Rate (Total → Interested)**\
  Percentage of all calls attempted that resulted in an interested lead.\
  Formula = Interested Calls ÷ Total Calls.

## 3. Call Pulses (Usage Metrics)

- **Pulse Definition:**\
  Every outbound call is measured in **pulses** for billing and tracking purposes.
  - **1 pulse = 1 minute**
  - Calls between 0–59 seconds are counted as **1 pulse**.
  - Calls of 60–119 seconds are counted as **2 pulses**, and so on.
- **Daily Pulse Count:**\
  The dashboard shows the **total number of pulses consumed per day**, giving users visibility into actual call-time utilization.
- **Pulse Efficiency:**\
  Average duration per connected call (pulses ÷ connected calls) can be used to benchmark agent efficiency.

## 4. Example Daily Flow

**Day: Sep 27, 2025**

- Total Calls: 500
- Connected Calls: 180
- Interested Calls: 30
- Lost Calls: 120
- Not Concluded: 50
- Pulses Consumed: 520

➡️ Interpretation:

- 36% connectivity rate (180 ÷ 500).
- 16.6% of connected leads showed interest (30 ÷ 180).
- Average call length = 520 pulses ÷ 180 connected ≈ 2.9 minutes.

## 5. Why the Daily Dashboard Matters

- **Real-Time Monitoring** – Gives daily visibility into lead response trends.
- **Resource Management** – Tracks call volume and minutes spent per day.
- **Performance Benchmarking** – Allows teams to compare one day’s efficiency and conversion to another, regardless of when leads were inserted.
- **Billing Transparency** – Daily pulse data ensures clarity on usage-based costs.
