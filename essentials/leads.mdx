## Adding Leads

You can add leads to Uservox in multiple ways:

Minimum recommended fields:

- name, phone, timezone
- optional: email, company, notes, campaign tags

## Operations on Leads

From the Dashboard:

- View and search: Filter by status, outcome, tags
- Update details: Edit contact info or custom fields
- Tagging: Organize leads by campaign, source, or segments
- Assign to Agent/Process: Enroll into a calling workflow
- Pause/Resume: Temporarily remove from dialing attempts
- Delete: Remove a lead from the system

From the API:
