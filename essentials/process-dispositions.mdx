title: "Process Dispositions"
description: "A Disposition represents the final outcome or status of a call handled by the voice agent. It helps categorize the result of every interaction ‚Äî whether successful, unsuccessful, or neutral ‚Äî for tracking performance, analytics, and follow-up actions. Examples include: Retail, Lost - Not Purchased, Lost to Co-dealer, Wrong Number, Inconclusive, No Connect, Callback Later/Busy, Voicemail, etc."

Each disposition has three key attributes:

- **Disposition Name** ‚Äì A short descriptive title for the call outcome.
- **Type** ‚Äì The classification of the result:
  - _Success_ ‚Äì Call achieved its goal (e.g., booking, confirmation) and will not be called again.
  - _Failure_ ‚Äì The call ended with a negative outcome (e.g., user declined, wrong number) and will not be called again.
  - _Neutral_ ‚Äì The call outcome was inconclusive or pending (e.g., voicemail, no connect) and will be called again via AI Bot.
- **Prompt/Description** ‚Äì A detailed note guiding when to use that disposition, helping agents or AI systems mark calls consistently.
