## Overview

A Process defines how Uservox engages a lead from first touch to outcome. It orchestrates attempts, timing, and next steps.

## Typical Flow

1. Enrollment
   - Lead is added to a Process (manually, via API, or via CRM integration)
2. Attempt Strategy
   - Configure call attempts per day, retry intervals, and call windows
3. Conversation Handling
   - Agent follows your conversation flow (greeting, qualification, FAQs)
   - Outcomes: qualified, not interested, voicemail, callback requested, no answer
4. Post-Call Actions
   - Log summary, transcript, sentiment, and key fields
   - Update CRM records and statuses
   - Schedule follow-ups if needed
5. Exit Criteria
   - Success (qualified/booked) or Disqualified
   - Max attempts reached or manual removal

## Tips

- Align outcomes with CRM stages
- Set local-time windows to boost pickup rates
- Keep retry counts reasonable to avoid spam labeling
