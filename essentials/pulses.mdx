title: "Pulse or Connected Minutes"
description: "A Connected Pulse represents the total duration of connected calls on UserVox. Each pulse equals one minute of connected talk time, rounded up to the next full minute — for example, 0–59 seconds count as 1 pulse, 60–119 seconds as 2 pulses, and so on. It helps track the actual usage of connected call minutes by your voice agents."

### What is a Connected Pulse?

A **Connected Pulse** represents the total connected call duration used by your voice agents on the UserVox platform.\
It measures how much talk-time was consumed during successful connections with customers.

- Each pulse equals **1 minute of connected call duration.**
- The count rounds up to the next full minute:
  - **0–59 seconds → 1 pulse**
  - **60–119 seconds → 2 pulses**
  - and so on.

So, for example:

| Call Duration | Pulses Used |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| 45 seconds    | 1           |
| 1 min 10 sec  | 2           |
| 2 min 20 sec  | 3           |

### How to Check Connected Pulses in UserVox

1. From the left sidebar, go to **Pulses**.
2. You’ll see the **Monthly Pulses Used** section.
   - Example: _October 2025 – 101,228 pulses_\
     This means 101,228 minutes of connected talk-time were consumed in October.

#### **Option 2: Pulses Dashboard**

1. From the profile dropdown, click **Pulses Dashboard**.
2. You’ll get a more detailed, date-wise or project-wise pulse usage breakdown.
3. Each pulse count here reflects only **connected** calls — attempts that were answered and reached the user.

### Relation Between Attempts, Connections, and Pulses

| Metric              | Meaning                                                                        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Attempts**  | All outbound call attempts (connected + missed + unreachable).                 |
| **Total Connected** | Calls where the user actually picked up.                                       |
| **Total Pulses**    | The total talk-time consumed for all connected calls (in minutes, rounded up). |

So for instance:

- **132,079 attempts** → all calls made.
- **45,083 connected** → actual successful connections.
- **101,228 pulses** → total talk minutes used for those 45,083 connections.
