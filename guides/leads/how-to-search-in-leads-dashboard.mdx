## Searching Leads by Date and Interested State

This section explains how users can search and narrow down leads using **date-based filters** and then further refine the results to view only **Interested leads** by applying the **State** filter. This approach is commonly used to review recent high-intent leads, monitor pipeline movement, or prepare follow-ups.

## Accessing Lead Search

1. Navigate to **Lead Search**.
2. Open the **Leads List** view.
3. Locate the search bar at the top of the page labeled:\
   _“Start typing text or choose a filter…”_

The search bar supports both free-text search and structured, rule-based filtering.

## Applying a Date-Based Filter

Date filters help restrict results to leads that were updated or acted upon within a specific time window.

### Steps

1. Click inside the search bar and open advanced filtering.
2. From the list of available fields, select a relevant **date field**, such as:
   - Updated At
   - Manually Scheduled At
   - Last State Transition
3. Choose a comparison condition:
   - Equals
   - Before
   - After
   - Between
4. Select the required date or date range.

### Result

Only leads that satisfy the selected date condition will remain visible in the leads list.

## Filtering Leads by Interested State

Once the date range is applied, you can further narrow results to only those leads that are currently marked as _Interested_.

### Steps

1. Add a new rule.
2. Select **State** as the field.
3. Set the condition to **equals**.
4. Choose **Interested** from the available states.

### Result

The leads list now shows only those leads that:

- Fall within the selected date range, and
- Are currently in the _Interested_ state.

## Using Multiple Filters Together

By default, filters are applied using **AND logic**, meaning:

- A lead must satisfy **all applied rules** to appear in the results.

For example:

- Updated At → Between 1 Jan and 31 Jan
- State → Interested

Only leads that meet **both conditions simultaneously** will be shown.

## Advanced Logic: AND vs OR

- **AND** is used to progressively narrow results.
- **OR** can be used when leads should match _any one_ of the conditions.

You may also group multiple rules together to create more advanced logical structures when required.

## Clearing or Modifying Filters

- Use **Clear Advanced** to remove all applied filters.
- Existing rules can be edited individually to refine the search without starting over.

## Summary

Using date filters in combination with the Interested state allows users to focus on:

- Recent leads with high intent
- Time-bound follow-up lists
- Performance analysis for specific periods

## Searching Leads Using Fields and Lead Metadata

This section explains how to search leads using **standard lead fields** and **custom lead metadata**, and how multiple filters can be combined to create precise and highly targeted lead searches.

## Understanding Lead Fields vs Lead Metadata

### Lead Fields

![Screenshot2026 01 30at12 38 08AM 1](/images/Screenshot2026-01-30at12.38.08AM-1.png)

Lead fields are system-defined attributes available for all leads. Examples include:

- Name
- Phone
- State
- Disposition
- Connected
- Meaningfully Connected
- Called
- Process ID
- Reference ID
- Updated At

These fields reflect the lead’s lifecycle and interaction history.

### Lead Metadata

Lead metadata consists of additional attributes associated with a lead, often originating from uploads, integrations, or enrichment processes.

![Screenshot2026 01 30at12 38 50AM](/images/Screenshot2026-01-30at12.38.50AM.png)

Examples include:

- City
- Dealer
- Dealer Name
- Dealer Address
- Make / Model
- Hindi Name
- Hi Make / Hi Model
- Circle
- UV Priority
- Upload ID
- Sir / Sir or Mam

Metadata enables more contextual and business-specific searches.

## Searching Using Lead Fields

### Steps

1. Click inside the search bar.
2. From the **Lead Fields** section, select the desired field.
3. Choose an appropriate condition (for example, equals or contains).
4. Enter or select the value.
5. Apply the rule.

The leads list updates immediately based on the applied condition.

## Searching Using Lead Metadata

### Steps

1. Click inside the search bar.
2. Scroll to the **Metadata** section.
3. Select the required metadata field.
4. Choose a condition such as equals or contains.
5. Enter the value.
6. Apply the rule.

This allows users to filter leads based on business-specific attributes such as city, model, or dealer information.

## Combining Multiple Filters to Narrow Results

Multiple filters can be applied together to progressively reduce the result set.

### Example Scenarios

- State equals Interested AND City equals Mumbai
- Model equals Nexon AND Dealer Name contains Auto
- Hindi Name exists AND UV Priority equals High
- State equals Interested AND Updated At after a specific date

Each additional filter further narrows the results by requiring the lead to satisfy more conditions.

## Using Groups for Complex Searches

When multiple conditions need to be evaluated together, filters can be grouped. Grouping helps structure complex queries, such as:

- Multiple metadata conditions evaluated together
- A mix of AND and OR logic across different rule sets

Groups ensure clarity and accuracy in advanced searches.

## Modifying or Clearing Search Criteria

- Individual rules can be edited or removed at any time.
- Use **Clear Advanced** to reset all applied filters and return to the full leads list.

## Summary

The Lead Search functionality enables users to:

- Search using core lead fields
- Filter using rich lead metadata
- Apply multiple filters to narrow results
- Combine conditions using logical operators
- Build precise views for sales, operations, or quality review
