## Why Queue Prioritization Matters

When many leads are waiting for calls, the system needs a clear rule for **who gets called next**.

This guide explains three queue strategies that control call order:

- **Default Attempt Priority** – Call leads in a simple waiting line.
- **Attempt Priority** – Always try brand-new leads first.
- **Last Attempted Priority** – Finish active leads quickly so they close faster.

Each strategy creates a different experience for how quickly different types of leads are contacted.

### Mixing strategies with percentages

You dont have to pick only one strategy. For each process, you can **mix and match** these three strategies by setting what **share of calls (%)** should use each one.

- The shares for the three strategies must always **add up to 100%**.
- For example, you might run **80%** of calls using the first-attempt strategy and **20%** using the default attempt order, with **0%** for lead-closure priority.

The screenshot below shows how this configuration looks in the app:

## 1. Default Attempt Priority

**Idea:** Treat the queue like a normal waiting line.

Every time a lead becomes ready for an attempt, it is placed at the **back of the queue**. Agents then call leads **from front to back**.

- Leads generally move in the order they arrive or become due.
- There is **no special preference** for first vs later attempts.

### How it feels in practice

Imagine people standing in a single line at a counter. Whoever is at the front gets served next.

- A new lead becomes ready → it joins the **end** of the line.
- When an attempt finishes and the next attempt is due, that attempt goes to the **end** as well.

## 2. Attempt Priority (First Attempts First)

**Idea:** **New leads get top priority.**

First attempts are treated as **more important** than any later attempt (2nd, 3rd, etc.).

- If a new lead enters the system, its **first attempt jumps ahead** of older leads that are waiting for follow-up attempts.
- Among all first attempts, we still respect when they arrived.

### How it feels in practice

Think of the queue as having two lanes:

- **Fast lane:** Leads on their **first attempt**.
- **Normal lane:** Leads on their **2nd, 3rd, or later attempts**.

The system always pulls from the **fast lane first**.

This means:

- Brand-new leads are called **very quickly**.
- Older leads still get follow-ups, but **only after** new first-attempt leads have been tried.

### When to use this

This strategy is useful when your top priority is to **respond to new inquiries as fast as possible**, even if some older leads wait longer between attempts.

## 3. Last Attempted Priority (Lead Closure)

**Idea:** Once you start working on a lead, **finish it quickly**.

Leads that were **attempted recently** are given higher priority for their **next attempt**.

- If a lead was just called, its next attempt is scheduled **sooner in the queue**.
- New leads may wait a bit longer if another lead is in the middle of a fast sequence of attempts.

### How it feels in practice

Imagine each lead as a short “story” you want to finish:

- When you touch a lead (make an attempt), the system tries to **complete the story** quickly by scheduling the next attempt soon.
- This creates short bursts of activity on the same lead until it is **clearly closed** (converted, disqualified, or completed).

### Why this helps

- Reduces the number of **half-finished leads** stuck in the middle of a sequence.
- Moves more leads to a clear outcome faster.
- Useful when you care about **closure speed** and don’t mind if some brand-new leads wait slightly longer.

### Visual

This diagram shows leads that were just attempted getting pulled forward again, so they are closed out faster.

## Process prioritization with channel weights

On the same screen, below the queue sorting priority, you can also **prioritize processes** using _Process Channel Weights_. This controls how your calling capacity is distributed across different processes or campaigns.

- Each row represents a process or channel.
- The **Weight (1-20)** value sets how important that process is relative to others.
- Higher weights receive a **larger share of calls** over time.

This lets you decide not just **how calls are ordered within a process** (via the three queue strategies), but also **how calls are divided across processes** based on your current business priorities.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

Here is a quick way to think about which strategy to use:

- **Default Attempt Priority**
  - Best when you want a **simple and fair** queue.
  - Everyone moves forward in roughly the order they arrive or become due.

- **Attempt Priority**
  - Best when **speed-to-first-contact** is your main goal.
  - New leads are always tried before follow-ups on older leads.

- **Last Attempted Priority**
  - Best when you want to **close leads quickly** once you start working on them.
  - Recently attempted leads are pushed forward to get a clear outcome.

You can choose the strategy that best matches your sales or outreach goals, and adjust it as your process evolves.
