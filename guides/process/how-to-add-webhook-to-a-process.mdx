title: "How to add Webhook to a process"
description: "Webhooks allow you to receive real-time updates about lead activity and process outcomes in your own system. By adding a webhook (called Lead Update Callback), you can push lead status, call activity, and disposition updates to your backend automatically.

This guide explains how to add and configure a webhook for a process."

## Step-by-Step: Add a Webhook to a Process

### 1. Open the Process

- Go to **Processes** from the main dashboard.

- Select the process where you want to add the webhook (e.g., _OutReach Plan (hinglish)_).

### 2. Go to Advanced Settings

- Inside the process details page, scroll down to **Advanced Settings**.

- Expand the section if it is collapsed.
- You will see **Lead Update Callbacks**.

### 3. Add a New Callback

- Click on **\+ Add Callback**.


- A new block (e.g., _Callback 1_) will appear.

### 4. Configure the Webhook

#### a. Lead Update URL

- Enter your webhook endpoint URL.

Example:

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/lead-callback
```

This endpoint will receive POST requests when lead updates occur.

#### b. Payload Format

Choose how much data you want to receive:

- **Activity Update – Only send updates related to latest activity** (recommended)

This sends updates only when something meaningful happens (call completed, disposition updated, etc.).

#### c. Callback Requirements (Optional)

- Enable **Requires source to be whitelisted** if your server only accepts requests from approved IPs.

#### d. Authentication (Optional)

If your endpoint requires authentication, configure one of the following:

- **Bearer Token**
  - Add a token that will be sent in the `Authorization` header.

OR

- **Custom Auth Header**
  - **Auth Key**: e.g. `X-API-Key`
  - **Auth Value**: your API key value

These headers will be included with every webhook request.

### 5. Save and Verify

- Make sure there are no validation errors (Advanced Settings should show **OK**, not **Errors**).
- Save the process if required.

Once saved, the webhook becomes active immediately.

## When Will the Webhook Fire?

The webhook is triggered when:

- A call attempt is completed
- Lead status changes (Interested, Not Interested, No Answer, etc.)
- Final disposition is marked
- The latest activity in the process changes

## Common Errors & Tips

- **Advanced Settings shows “Errors”**
  - Check that the Lead Update URL is valid (HTTPS recommended)
  - Ensure required auth fields are correctly filled
- **No callbacks received**
  - Confirm your endpoint accepts `POST` requests
  - Verify authentication headers
  - Check server logs for rejected requests

## Best Practices

- Use a dedicated endpoint for webhooks
- Log incoming payloads for debugging
- Respond with HTTP `200 OK` quickly to avoid retries
- Secure the endpoint using auth headers
